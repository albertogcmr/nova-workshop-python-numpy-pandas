    "Many of the libraries you will use to perform data analysis in Python, as well as many of the mathematical functions you’ll use, will involve working with Numpy. Numpy (short for Numerical Python) is used for numeric computing and includes support for multi-dimensional arrays and matrices along with a variety of mathematical functions to apply to them. In this lesson, we will learn about Numpy’s primary data structures and how to apply some basic math functions to them.\n",

    "## Importing Numpy\n",
    "\n",

    "The basic data structures in Numpy are arrays, which can be used to represent tabular data. You can think of arrays as lists of lists, where all the elements of a list are of the same type (typically numeric since the reason you use Numpy is to do numeric computing). A matrix is just a two-dimensional array.\n",

    "The size of an array is the total number of elements in every list. The shape of an array is the size of the array along each dimension (e.g. number of rows and number of columns for a two-dimensional array). Let’s create a two dimensional 10 x 4 array containing random numbers and calculate the shape and size of the array using the shape and size methods."
